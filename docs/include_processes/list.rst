Browsing processes
------------------

Select *Processes* in the main menu to browse your organization’s processes.
Each process has an icon that indicates what kind of :ref:`trigger <triggers>` it has, the process owner’s avatar and the process name.
You can also add labels to categorize processes.
If you have published a process, you can use the button to :ref:`start a new case <start-process>`.

Filtering the processes list
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To make it easier to browse a long processes list, you can filter the list so it only includes the processes you want.
You can use a combination of several filters, to limit the list to processes that match the selection.

* *Labels* - select one or more labels
* *Owner* - select a user
* *Trigger* - select a trigger type: *Email*, *Form*, *Manual*, *Salesforce* or *Signavio Approval Workflow*
* *More Filters* - select a publication status: *Published* or *Unpublished*

To remove a filter, select it again.
