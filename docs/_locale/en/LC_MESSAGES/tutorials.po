"This tutorial introduces the simplest way to get started with Workflow "
"Accelerator. You can start without first defining a process by :ref"
":`start-adhoc`."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"People often use workflows for document approvals, so this tutorial uses "
"the example of approving a report, called *June report*."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"In the main menu, select *Cases* and then select *Cases without a "

msgid "Your first document approval process"
msgstr ""

msgstr ""

msgid "Using organisation groups to define task candidates"
msgstr ""

msgid "Using process roles to automatically assign tasks"
msgstr ""

msgid "Using access control to restrict process actions"
msgstr ""

msgid "Adding a decision to an approval process"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"An approval process such as a document approval requires a clear "
"decision, such as whether to *Approve* or *Reject* a document. This "
"tutorial continues the document approval process example from the "
"previous tutorial and shows you how to add a manual decision to a user "
"task form."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"To start, create a basic approval process with a single user task, as in "
"the :ref:`first document process <tutorial-new-process>` tutorial:"
msgstr ""

msgid "A basic approval process with a single task"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This basic process already includes the task for making an approval "
"decision, but it doesn’t give any guidance for making the decision. You "
"can improve this process so that the approval task’s form has *Approve* "
"and *Reject* buttons, like this:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The result of adding a decision - a task form with *Approve* and *Reject*"
" buttons"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"In the process model, an :ref:`exclusive-gateway` after the user task "
"will represent the decision. To add the gateway to the model, select the "
"*Exclusive gateway* button in the tool palette. This adds the diamond "
"shape with an X to the diagram."
msgstr ""

msgid "Adding an exclusive gateway to the process model"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Next, drag the end event to the right, to make room for the gateway, and "
"drag the gateway symbol onto the transition from the user task to the end"
" event as shown:"
msgstr ""

msgid "Moving the gateway to an existing transition"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"For the next step, add a new path to the process that represents the "
"decision to reject the document. This means adding a second transition "
"from the exclusive gateway to a new end event. To do this, select the "
"exclusive gateway, and drag the end event (circle) icon to where you want"
" to new end event, as shown:"
msgstr ""

msgid "Adding a transition from the gateway to a new end event"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Name the new end event to describe the alternate end status, to make the "
"diagram easier to understand. Select the event and enter the name "
"**report rejected**."
msgstr ""

msgid "Naming the alternate end event with a different end status"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Now you can configure the gateway with the decision. To use an exclusive "
"gateway for a manual decision, it must have an incoming transition from a"
" user task and more than one outgoing transition. Select the exclusive "
"gateway to open its configuration pane, and enter the decision options "
"**Approve** and **Reject**, using the end event names to get them the "
"right way around."
msgstr ""

msgid "Configuring *Approve* and *Reject* decisions on an exclusive gateway"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"You can see the result of configuring the manual decision on the user "
"task form. Select the user task, which opens its configuration pane’s "
"*Form* tab. At the bottom, underneath where any fields would appear, you "
"now see the decision options as *Approve* and *Reject* buttons. In the "
"form description field, enter instructions for making the decision: "
"**Approve or reject the attached draft report**."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Adding a description to a task form that now shows *Approve* and *Reject*"
" buttons"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Now you can see the result of adding the decision to the process. Select "
"the *Publish changes* button (top-right) to publish a new version of the "
"process, then select *Start case* next to the latest version in the list."
" Start the case, completing the trigger form if you added one, and open "
"the *Approve report* task. The task page shows the task form with the "
"description you entered, and the decision buttons."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Running the process - the form for a manual decision with *Approve* and "
"*Reject* buttons"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Select *Approve* to record the decision and complete the user task. The "
"case view event stream (right) now shows the *Approve* decision."
msgstr ""

msgid "After completing the form, the event stream shows the *Approve* decision"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Decisions like these don’t only occur in document approval processes. In "
"practice, many kinds of business processes use one or manual decisions "
"that you can add in the same way."
