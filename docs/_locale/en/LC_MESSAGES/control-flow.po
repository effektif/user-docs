msgid "Control flow"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"You use transitions, gateways and events to specify the processing order "
"of the actions in a process."
msgstr ""

msgid "Transition"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The :ref:`process builder <processes>` displays a transition an arrow "
"from a source element to a destination element. The transition specifies "
"that the workflow engine only ‘executes’ the destination element after "
"completing the source element. BPMN calls a transition a ‘sequence flow’."
msgstr ""

msgid "Exclusive gateway"
msgstr ""

msgid "An exclusive gateway in the process editor"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Use an exclusive gateway to make a choice between multiple execution "
"paths. The exclusive gateway selects one of the outgoing transitions, and"
" only continues execution on that transition. You can configure an "
"exclusive gateway with a *manual decision* or an *automatic decision*."
msgstr ""

msgid "Manual decision"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Use a manual decision for an exclusive gateway when a person must make a "
"decision. A user task must precede the gateway; this task includes making"
" the decision. The user interface presents the decision to the user as "
"buttons on the user task form."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Suppose you have a user task called ‘Review contract’, an exclusive "
"gateway and the two user tasks ‘Print contract’ and ‘Update contract’:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"An exclusive gateway must have at least one incoming and two outgoing "
"transitions"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Select the exclusive gateway. Its type defaults to *manual decision*. "
"After creating the elements and connecting them, as above, you have "
"configured the exclusive gateway:"
msgstr ""

msgid "Default manual decision configuration"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"In order to use the decision you need to name the buttons which will "
"represent the decision. For each button, the label on the right indicates"
" the next action in the process, which Signavio Workflow Accelerator will"
" perform when someone clicks the button. In this example, when the user "
"clicks the decision button `Print contract`, Workflow Accelerator "
"executes the `Print contract` task, but *not* the `Update contract` task."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"You can easily change the text on the buttons, and order they appear in. "
"For example, change them to `Approve` and `Reject`, and drag the "
"`Approve` button configuration to the top so that `Approve` appears first"
" on the form:"
msgstr ""

msgid "Customized decision buttons"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"After starting a new case for this process, the `Review contract` task "
"will have decision buttons:"
msgstr ""

msgid "Task decision buttons"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"When the task before the exclusive gateway - `Review contract` in this "
"example - has a form, the form includes the decision buttons."
msgstr ""

msgid "Manual decision variable"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Adding a manual decision to a process also creates a :ref:`workflow "
"variable <variables>`. You can use this to re-use the result of a "
"decision later in the process, either to display the entered value on "
"another form, or to use the value in an automatic decision’s condition."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"During workflow execution, selecting a decision sets the variable's value"
" to the selected decision - the text on the decision button. In this "
"example, the decision variable has the value ‘Approve’ or ‘Reject’."
msgstr ""

msgid "Decision variable values - ‘Approve’ or ‘Reject’"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The variable has the name ‘Decision’, by default, or the name of the "
"gateway if it has one. You can change the variable name on the process "
"editor’s `Details` tab, in the `Field overview`."
msgstr ""

msgid "Automatic decision"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"An exclusive gateway that selects an outgoing transition based on "
"conditions that you choose models an automatic decision. For each "
"transition, you can formulate a condition using workflow data. The "
"workflow engine evaluates transition conditions in order, from top to "
"bottom. The workflow engine will take the transition with the first "
"condition that evaluates to true, using the current case’s field values."
msgstr ""

msgid "Automatic decision condition editor"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"To specify a condition, start by selecting a field and a comparison "
"operator. Enter either a static value in the input field on the right, or"
" click the |binding-symbol| button to select another field."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"A condition can include multiple field value comparisons. To add more "
"sub-conditions, click the button at the bottom of the list. You can also "
"use the select field at the top to specify that either **all** conditions"
" in the list must evaluate to true, or that at least one of them must "
"evaluate to true."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If you do not completely specify a sub-condition, evaluating the whole "
"condition will fail and the workflow engine will not follow the "
"transition. The |warning-symbol| symbol indicates an incomplete sub-"
"condition, while the |check-symbol| symbol indicates a valid sub-"
"condition. Click either of these symbols to remove the sub-condition from"
" the list."
msgstr ""

msgid "Default transition"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"An automatic decision usually has a default transition. You use a default"
" transition as a fallback mechanism: if none of the conditions evaluate "
"to true, the workflow engine follows the default transition."
msgstr ""

msgid "The default transition"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"To make a transition the default, select the ‘per default’ item in the "
"selection field at the top."
msgstr ""

msgid "Parallel Gateway"
msgstr ""

msgid "A parallel gateway in the process editor"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Use parallel gateways to model tasks that people will complete at the "
"same time as each other, or one at a time but not in a particular order. "
"To do this, you *fork* and *join* the sequence flow."
msgstr ""

msgid "Forking"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"With a parallel gateway, you can fork execution into multiple, concurrent"
" flows. When process execution arrives in a parallel gateway, the "
"workflow engine creates a new individual execution flow for each of the "
"gateway’s outgoing transitions. Let’s look at the following purchase "
"order example:"
msgstr ""

msgid "A parallel gateway example"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"In this example, completing the `Enter purchase order` user task "
"activates the parallel gateway. The parallel gateway will create two "
"individual paths of execution. One will take the transition to `Receive "
"payment` and create that user task. Meanwhile, the other will create the "
"`Send goods` user task."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"You can have as many outgoing transitions as you want. The workflow "
"engine will create all destination tasks for those transitions at once."
msgstr ""

msgid "Joining"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"You also use a parallel gateway to join concurrent paths back together. "
"In this case, the joining parallel gateway has more then one incoming "
"transition. Workflow execution will wait at the gateway until as many "
"execution flows arrive as it has incoming transitions. When the last "
"concurrent flow arrives, the joining parallel gateway will activate and "
"the workflow engine will create one execution flow on the outgoing "
"transition."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"To continue the previous example, extend the purchase order process to "
"look:"
msgstr ""

msgid "A parallel gateway example with join"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"In this example, `Archive purchase order` will only start after people "
"complete both the `Receive payment` and `Send goods` tasks."
msgstr ""

msgid "Default forking"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"By default, the workflow engine interprets multiple outgoing transitions "
"from an action as parallel tasks. This means that if you have multiple "
"transitions from a user task, the workflow engine will create  concurrent"
" tasks for all of the transitions’ destination actions. Let’s look at a "
"simple example."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"After `Send goods` completes, the workflow engine will create the tasks "
"`Receive payment` and `Send goods` immediately."
msgstr ""

msgid "You can combine default forking with a parallel gateway for joining."
msgstr ""

msgid "Default merging"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"When multiple transitions lead to a user task, the workflow engine will "
"start the user task once for each execution flow that arrives. This means"
" that the workflow engine does not perform implicit joining for parallel "
"flows."
msgstr ""

msgid "Parallel gateway issues"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"You will end up with problems if you loop back over parallel gateways. To"
" avoid situations:"
msgstr ""

msgid "Undesirable loopback"
msgstr ""

msgid "and this:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"To avoid these issues, think of all actions between forking and joining "
"as a self-contained part of the process, such that no transitions should "
"cross that scope."
msgstr ""

msgid "Start event"
msgstr ""

msgid "A start event in the process editor"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"A start event marks the start of a process. All process elements that do "
"not have incoming transitions act as start elements. Start events don’t "
"have a direct connection to triggers. You can usually leave out start "
"events if you want to create more concise diagrams."
msgstr ""

msgid "End event"
msgstr ""

msgid "An end event in the process editor"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Like start events, you can also omit end events. End events mark the end "
"of an execution flow:"
msgstr ""

msgid "Equivalently:"
msgstr ""

msgid "No end event"
msgstr ""

msgid "Intermediate timer event"
msgstr ""

msgid "An intermediate timer event in the process editor"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"An intermediate timer event indicates that process execution waits for a "
"timer. You can use this to prevent Workflow Accelerator creating the next"
" task in a process until it becomes relevant."
msgstr ""

msgid "Using an intermediate timer event to model an evaluation period"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Configure how long the timer waits by selecting the timer in the process "
"editor. In an open case, you can :ref:`skip a timer <tasks-skip-timer>` "
"manually."
msgstr ""

msgid "Milestone"
msgstr ""

msgid "A milestone in the process editor"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"A milestone is an intermediate event which allows you to mark an "
"important event or a turning point within a process. By setting "
"milestones, process owners obtain an overview of the workflow progress."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"You can set a milestone either by using the intermediate event or via a "
"script task."
msgstr ""

msgid "**Script task sample**:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"When using the intermediate event, you can reuse any variables from the "
"workflow to create the milestone text by typing ``#``."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"To show the current milestone, add the field 'Case/Milestone' as a column"
" in the case list."
