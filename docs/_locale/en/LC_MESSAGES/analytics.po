msgid ""
"When you work in or manage a team, you sometimes have questions about the"
" work in progress or completed work. For example, management decisions "
"about team resources might depend on what work the team completed last "
"month and what work remains incomplete. While day-to-day case work "
"focuses on completing one task at a time, managing a team of case workers"
" demands an aggregated overview of the team’s work."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The `Analytics` menu makes it possible to create and share reports that "
"provide these overviews. Each report runs on demand and aggregates a "
"process’ cases in tabular and graphical form in the web user interface."
msgstr ""

msgid "Creating a new report"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"To create a new report, select `Analytics` in the menu, and then `Create "
"new report`. Enter a name for your report that describes the data, such "
"as *First quarter sales*. The finish setting up a basic report, use the "
"list labelled `Select a process` to choose one of your organization’s "
"published reports."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"When you create a report and select a process, the report shows a table "
"of all of the process’ cases. This report now appears in the list of "
"reports that you see when you select `Analytics`. By default, only you "
"can see the report in the list."

msgid "Viewing and exporting results"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The report page’s table shows cases, with one case per row. The table "
"header indicates the number of cases included in the report. Select "
"`Configure columns` to choose which columns the table includes. This "
"works the same way as :ref:`configure-columns`."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If you have special presentation requirements, you may want to use the "
"same data to produce your own report using different software. To do "
"this, you can download the same data as a `CSV file "
"<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values>`_ that you can "
"open in spreadsheet software."
msgstr ""

msgid "Selecting cases to include"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"For most reports, you won’t want to include all of a process’ cases. "
"After all, the :ref:`Cases view <cases-overview>` already shows an "
"overview of all cases. Instead, you can restrict which cases the report "
"includes, by status or by the values of the process’ :ref:`variables`."
msgstr ""

msgid "Selecting a process and whether to include open or closed cases"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"In this example, the *Evaluate training course* process collects ratings "
"for training courses. To create a report that uses these evaluations, "
"select closed cases, which correspond to completed evaluations."
msgstr ""

msgid "Excluding cases with filters"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Filtering by status lets you create separate reports for completed work, "
"such as a monthly productivity report, and outstanding work. To filter "
"cases by status, use the first pick-list to select between `all cases`, "
"`open cases` and `closed cases`."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"To filter cases by variables’ values, first select `Add a filter "
"condition`. This adds a field condition, which works the same way as an "
":ref:`exclusive-gateway-automatic` condition. Select a field, such as "
"`Case / End date`, a condition, such as `is after`, and a value, such as "
"the last day of the previous month."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Using a filter to exclude evaluations for courses other than *Time "
"management*"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"You can add multiple conditions to further restrict which cases the "
"report includes. A monthly case report would have two conditions for the "
"`Case / End date` field, using the `is after` and `is before` conditions "
"to define a date range."
msgstr ""

msgid "Grouping and charts"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"As well as listing cases in a table, you can also group cases by one of "
"the process variables, so that cases with the same value appear together "
"in the table. Grouping cases can also add a visualisation to the report."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"To show a pie chart of the different values for a variable, such as the "
"course evaluation ratings, select the *Rating* variable from the *Group "
"by* list. Then select the *Count* of *Case* values to count the "
"evaluations with each distinct rating value."

"course, group by the *Course* (title) and show the *Average* of *Rating* "
"values."
