msgid "Cases"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"You can use a case as a small collaboration space for a particular goal. "
"For example, ‘Hire employee’ or ‘Sign contract’. Cases typically "
"represent more work than a simple task for a single person, but less than"
" a whole project."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"A case breaks the goal down into concrete action items (or tasks) so you "
"can collaborate with other people. The case brings together a set of "
"tasks, a discussion and documents, and allows participants to share any "
"relevant context information for the tasks."
msgstr ""

msgid "Starting an ad-hoc case"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Signavio Workflow supports two types of cases: cases that relate to a "
"process and ad-hoc cases. An *ad-hoc case* does not have a predefined "
"process. It creates a collaboration space that you can use to reach a "
"one-off goal."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"To create a new ad-hoc case, navigate to *Cases*; on the *Cases of* menu,"
" select *Cases without a process*, then click *Start new case*."
msgstr ""

msgid "Start a new task"
msgstr ""

msgid "Then the case header appears."
msgstr ""

msgid "Enter case name"

msgid "Starting a new process case"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"A *process case* uses the latest version of the workflow defined by a "
"published process. It creates a collaboration space for working towards a"
" predefined goal."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"You can create a new process case by selecting the *Start new case* "
"button in one of three places:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"in the process builder, on the :ref:`versions` page, next to the latest "
"published version"
msgstr ""

msgid "on the *Processes* page, next to the name of each published process"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"on the :ref:`cases overview <cases-overview>` page, for the selected "
"process."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If the process does not define a trigger, then you enter a case name as "
"when :ref:`start-adhoc`. Other trigger types generate their own case "
"names, or use a :ref:`case name template <details>`."
msgstr ""

msgid "Viewing cases"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The *Cases* view shows an overview of cases for a single process. To open"
" the Cases view, select *Cases* from the main menu."
msgstr ""

msgid "The Cases view - cases of the ‘Hire employee’ process"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The table shows cases for the *Hire employee* process. You can use the "
"menu above the table to select a different process, ad hoc cases that "
"don’t have a process, or cases of a deleted process. Each case in the "
"table show the case name, grey and green task status bars, and additional"
" columns that show the values of workflow :ref:`variables <variables>`."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The grey and green status bars show information about completed and open "
"tasks when you hover the mouse cursor over them."
msgstr ""

msgid "Hover over the grey bar to see a case’s completed tasks."
msgstr ""

msgid "Hover over the open bar to see a case’s open tasks."

msgid "Case details view, showing one task and the event stream"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Each case has an event stream that acts as an audit log and includes the "
"information that case participants share during collaboration, such as "
"comments, documents and links."
msgstr ""

msgid "Customizing case view table columns"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The *Cases* view’s table includes columns for workflow :ref:`variables "
"<variables>`, which usually correspond to form fields on a trigger form "
"or in a user task. You can select which fields the Cases view shows as "
"table columns, so you can have a clear overview of the process’ cases."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"To customize the table columns, open the Cases view and click the top-"

msgstr ""

msgid "Adding a column to the table"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The menu lists all of the workflow variables that the table does not "
"currently include. In this example, the *Interviewer* variable has the "

msgstr ""

msgid "Commenting on a case"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Working on a case often includes collaboration with other people. You can"

msgstr ""

msgid "Comments on a case - discussion with context"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"By using case comments instead of email, participants ensure that "
"discussions retain the full context for everyone involved."

msgstr ""

msgid "Hover over the relative time to see the comment’s full time stamp:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"To add a comment, type in the text box above the event stream. Everyone "
"who has access to the case can follow the discussion. Keeping the "
"discussion ‘inside’ the case preserves the context, which makes it easier"
" to follow than an email conversation."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Sometimes, you want to direct a comment to a specific person. While "
"entering a comment, you can ‘mention’ someone by typing a ``@`` and "
"choosing their name from the list. When you mention someone in a comment,"
" Signavio Workflow sends them an email notification to bring them into "
"the discussion."
msgstr ""

msgid "Mentioning someone in a comment"
msgstr ""

msgid "A hyperlink in a case comment"
msgstr ""

msgid "Attaching documents to a case"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"As well as commenting on a case, to share information with the case’s "
"participants, you can attach documents. For example, cases in a job "
"vacancy process might require candidate CVs. Anyone can access the case "
"can download a case’s documents, which makes them more useful than email "
"attachments."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"To attach a document to a case, select the the `Upload a document` option"
" next to where you add comments."
msgstr ""

msgid "A document attached to a case"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The case’s event stream shows the document, with its file name and size. "
"Click the icon on the right to open the document."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If cases regularly require the same document as part of the process, you "
"can make this clearer to people who work on cases by adding a file upload"
" form field to a :ref:`user task form <user-task-form>`."
msgstr ""

msgid "Closing a case manually"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"You normally close a case by completing all of its tasks. However, "

msgstr ""

msgid "Closing a case"
msgstr ""

msgid ""

msgstr ""

msgid "Deleting a case"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"You do not normally delete cases in Signavio Workflow: you close cases "
"that you have finished working on. However, you sometimes do need to "
"delete cases, such as the test cases that you create while developing the"
" initial versions of a process model."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"To delete a case, open the case and use its right-hand actions menu to "

msgstr ""

msgid "Exporting cases data"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"You can export the information about a process’ cases to a `CSV file "
"<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values>`_ that you can "
"open in a spreadsheet. To export case data, open the :ref:`Cases overview"
" <cases-overview>`, select a process, and then select *Export as CSV*. "
"You may find this useful for reporting or auditing, for example."
msgstr ""

msgid "CSV export options"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Use the CSV export options to specify the ordering of exported cases, "
"whether to filter by status (open or closed), and the output format. Try "
"a different output format option if you have problems loading the "
"exported CSV file into another application, such as Microsoft Excel. The "
"output format options determine which characters the CSV output uses to "
"quote and separate characters and lines:"
msgstr ""

msgid "*Standard* - conventional CSV format"
msgstr ""

msgid "*Excel* - Microsoft Excel compatibility mode"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"*Excel (Northern Europe)* - better Excel compatibility for some European "

msgid "*Tabs* - separate values with tabs instead of commas."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The CSV export uses *UTF-8 text encoding*. Select *UTF-8* when opening "
