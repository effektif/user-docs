msgid ""
"A process defines a template for automating repetitive work, like a "
"recipe that describes the actions that you perform to achieve a goal. For"
" example, consider a `Hire employee <https://www.signavio.com/workflow-"
"examples/hire-employee/>`_ process. Each time an organization hires "
"someone, the recruitment team has to complete a number of tasks, "
"including ‘Evaluate CV’, ‘Plan interview’ and ‘Interview candidate’. Each"
" time someone starts the process, Workflow Accelerator creates a new "
"case."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Use the process builder to create and configure executable processes. You"
" can think of an executable process as a kind of software, but you will "
"find it easier to build automation using processes. With Workflow "
"Accelerator, non-technical people can create useful processes."
msgstr ""

msgid "Browsing processes"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Select *Processes* in the main menu to browse your organization's "
"processes. Each process has an icon that indicates what kind of "
":ref:`trigger <triggers>` it has, the process owner’s avatar and the "
"process name. You can also add labels to categorize processes. If you "
"have published a process, you can use the button to :ref:`start a new "
"case <start-process>`."
msgstr ""

msgid "Filtering the processes list"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"To make it easier to browse a long processes list, you can filter the "
"list so it only includes the processes you want. You can use a "
"combination of several filters, to limit the list to processes that match"
" the selection."

msgid "Manual trigger"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"A manual trigger gives you the simplest way to start a process. With a "

msgid "Email trigger"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"An email trigger starts a new case for each email that you send to the "

msgid ""
"You can use an email trigger by adding the trigger email address to a "
"mailing list, such as `support@example.com `or `info@example.com`. You’ll"
" have to ask the administrator of the mailing list to add the process "
"trigger’s email address to the list. Once you have done this, the process"
" trigger address will also receive any email sent to the mailing list, "
"starting the process in Workflow Accelerator. You will then see the email"
" in the event stream:"

msgid "Trigger mail in stream"
msgstr ""

msgid "Salesforce trigger"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"A Salesforce trigger starts a new case in response to Salesforce sending "
"an outbound message as part of a Salesforce workflow. Before you can use "
"a Salesforce trigger, configure :ref:`Salesforce Integration <salesforce-"

msgid "Actions"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Actions represent the steps in a process - things to do. Action include "
"things like user tasks in Workflow Accelerator, operations on a file in a"
" document management system or any other actions that represent work that"
" someone will perform as part of a process. When starting a process, "
"Workflow Accelerator will ‘execute’ the actions in a process in the "
"proper order. The process :ref:`control flow <control-flow>` determines "
"this ordering, using transitions, gateways and events."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"A process can include different :ref:`action-types`. A user task will "
"create a task in a case. A ‘Send Email’ action will send an email. A "
"‘Google file upload’ action will upload a file to a Google Drive folder."
msgstr ""

msgid "The *Process builder*’s actions palette"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The `BPMN "
"<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_Process_Model_and_Notation>`_ "
"diagram editor shows actions and control flow elements, such as events "
"and gateways. Use the diagram editor to add sequential flows between "
"actions, decisions and other control flow behaviour."
msgstr ""

msgid "Adding a transition"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"You can create a transition in the `Advanced flows` view. A transition "
"specifies sequential flow, which means the next action only starts when "
"someone has completed the previous one."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"To add a transition, click to select the first action. Several symbols "
"appear to the right of the selected element:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Start creating a transition by dragging the transition symbol to the "
"destination"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Click the transition symbol |transition-symbol| and drag it to the "
"destination element. When you drag the symbol over the destination "
"element, it indicates that you can drop to create the transition:"
msgstr ""

msgid "Creating a transition hovering over destination"
msgstr ""

msgid "Release the mouse button over the destination to create the transition."
msgstr ""

msgid "Creating the next user task"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"You can easily create the next User Task in a process in the same way you"
" created transitions, above. Start by selecting the previous action:"
msgstr ""

msgid "Start creating the next user task by dragging the action symbol"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Click the rounded rectangle symbol |task-symbol| and drag it to an empty "
"place on the canvas."
msgstr ""

msgid "Drag the rounded rectangle symbol to an empty place"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Drop the symbol where you want to create the next user task. Release the "
"mouse button to create new user task where you dropped it, with a "
"transition from the previous action."
msgstr ""

msgid "Adding the next user task and its transition at the same time"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Alternatively, just click the user task icon |task-symbol| to create a "
"new user task in the default location, with a transition."
msgstr ""

msgid "Changing the action type"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Sometimes, modifying a process means changing an action from one type to "
"another. In the recruitment process, you might change the action to "
"reject the candidate from a manual task to an automatic email task."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"To make this change, first select the action in the process editor to "
"open the configuration panel, then click the action type icon at the top-"
"left corner of the configuration panel to open the list of action types. "
"Next, select *Send Email* from the list to change the action type."
msgstr ""

msgid "Changing a :ref:`user-task` to a :ref:`send-email` task."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Changing the action type discards the previous action type’s "
"configuration, such as a user task form or an email template. If you "
"change the action type back, the editor will not restore the original "
"configuration."
msgstr ""

msgid "Control flow elements"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The diagram also includes control flow elements, such as events and "
"gateways. Unlike actions, control flow elements don’t represent something"
" that should happen. Instead, you use events and gateways to specify the "
"flow between the actions."

msgid ""
"In the process builder, select the *Details* tab to further configure the"
" process."
msgstr ""

msgid "Configuring process details"
msgstr ""

msgid "On the *General* tab, configure the following process properties."
msgstr ""

"*Process owner* - shown on the *Processes* page to indicate who has "
"responsibility for a process model, and used as the default recipient of "
"some :ref:`notifications <notifications>`."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"*Process description* - documents a process, usually by describing the "
"process goal."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"*Case name template* - the name for new cases of this process, usually "
"containing trigger :ref:`variables <variables>` so that each case has a "
"different name."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Use the *Access control* tab to restrict access to this process and its "
"cases."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Use the *Field overview* tab to view and rename this process’ "
":ref:`variables <variables>`."
msgstr ""

msgid "Versions"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"When you use the process editor to edit your process model, Workflow "
"Accelerator saves all of your changes immediately. You can go back and "
"edit the process again later, and it will not have changed. However, to "
"execute a process by starting a new case you need a published version."
msgstr ""

msgid "Publishing a process version"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The process editor’s `Versions` tab shows a list of published versions. "
"Until you publish the first version, this page shows a message that there"
" the process has ‘no published versions’."
msgstr ""

msgid "The process editor’s `Versions` tab with no published versions"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"You can only start a new case for a process that has a published version,"
" hence the light green button displays ‘Publish to run this process’. "
"After you publish the first version, the list shows version #1 and you "
"can start a new case using that version."
msgstr ""

msgid "The `Versions` list after publishing the first version"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Version #1 always has the description `Initial version`. For later "
"versions, you can add your own description."
msgstr ""

msgid "Adding version comments"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"After the first published version, you can add a comment to describe the "
"changes when you publish a new version of a process."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The `Publish changes` prompt, where you can add an optional version "
"comment"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"You can omit the version comment, but it helps collaboration between team"
" members by making process modelling more transparent."
msgstr ""

msgid "Published versions with descriptive version comments"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"In this example, each version has a short comment that describes the "
"changes."
msgstr ""

msgid "Writing good version comments"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"When you write version comments, use the following tips to make them more"
" consistent and useful."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Make the comment an imperative phrase that starts with a word like ‘Add’ "
"or ‘Fix’."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Capitalise the first word and don’t include a full-stop at the end, for "
"consistency."
msgstr ""

msgid "Describe specifics, instead of vaguely referring to ‘changes’."
msgstr ""

msgid "Keep it short; 3-10 words usually suffice."
msgstr ""

msgid "Consider making the comment longer to explain why you made this change."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"You may find it easier to publish a series of small changes, creating a "
"number of intermediate versions instead of one big change. Fine-grained "
"versions make the version history more useful."
msgstr ""

msgid "Variables"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"*Variables* contain the workflow data that the process defines. You can "
"use variables in a case name template and when configuring the output of "
"some action types. For example, you can use variables to repeat workflow "
"data on a :ref:`user task form <user-task-form>`, or include a variable "
"value in an :ref:`email task <send-email>` subject line or body text."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"These variables contain all of the information from forms as well as "
"information required by the process actions. Each case stores its own "
"values for each workflow variable."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"You will usually add a variable to your workflow by adding a :ref:`form "
"field <form-fields>`. You can also create variables in a :ref"
":`javascript-action`, to capture data that the script retrieves or "
"calculates."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"A trigger form that populates *Name* and *Date of birth* variables for "
"use in a workflow"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"In addition to your own workflow variables, Workflow Accelerator "
"automatically creates variables that give you access to additional data "
"in each case. The :ref:`case-variable` contains data from when Workflow "
"Accelerator creates the case. An :ref:`email-trigger` adds an :ref:`Email"
" variable <trigger-email-variable>` that contains the trigger email."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Variables can have different :ref:`data-types` that determine which kind "
"of data the variable stores, such as text or a date, and whether the data"
" has a single value or contains multiple fields."
msgstr ""

msgid "Roles"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Creating a role gives a process-specific name to whoever performs one or "
"more process tasks. You can optionally configure a role with a list of "
"candidates. Roles have the same function as swimlanes in BPMN."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Process roles differ from organizational roles. A process role only lasts"
" for the duration of a case, while organizational roles last longer and "
"relate to the job you perform at the organization. For example, when you "
"have a meeting, one person sometimes takes the role of chairperson. That "
"person doesn’t have the job title *Meeting chair* - they’ve just adopted "
"that role for the duration of the meeting."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"A process in Workflow Accelerator can define roles, in the same way that "
"a business meeting ‘process’ has roles for whoever chairs the meeting "
"(the ‘Chair’) and whoever takes minutes (the ‘Secretary’). The following "
"meeting process model assigns the tasks on the top row to the *Chair* and"
" the tasks on the bottom row to the *Secretary*."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"A *Meeting* process, with tasks for *Chair* (top row) and *Secretary* "
"(bottom row) roles"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"In each meeting (each :ref:`case <cases>` in Workflow Accelerator), one "
"person takes the role of chair, and one the role of secretary. These "
"assignments generally don’t change during a meeting. Similarly, Workflow "
"Accelerator role assignments don’t change during a case. Workflow "
"Accelerator automatically assigns each new task with a role assignment to"
" the person who already has the role."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"In Workflow Accelerator, a process role works like a workflow variable "
"that you use to assigning tasks. A role variable has the :ref:`type-user`"
" type and stores a single user."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"These process roles differ from organization roles. For example, you can "
"have the *Team lead* role in your organization, an assignment that does "
"not necessarily have an end date. A process role, such as *Meeting "
"chair*, has a different scope and only applies for the duration of a "
"single case."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"To assign a role to a user task, open the task’s configuration panel, "
"select the `Assignment` tab, and use the `Assign using a role` menu on "
"the right-hand side."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"To assign a role, use the menu to create a new role or select an existing"
" role"
msgstr ""

msgid "You can also use the edit icon next to the role name to rename the role."
msgstr ""

msgid "Role candidates"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"You can use a role to assign multiple tasks a person from a group of "
"candidates. For example, you might have a support process that includes "
"three user tasks that you assign to a support engineer."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Assigning a task to a *Support engineer* role with candidates Alice and "
"Ben"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Instead, assign the three tasks to a new role called ‘Support engineer’, "
"and add the relevant people as candidates for the role."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Creating the first task that has a role will notify all of the candidates"
" for the role. When one of the candidates takes the task, Workflow "
"Accelerator will assign the subsequent tasks with the same role to the "
"same person. That helps this person work more efficiently because they "
"have the context knowledge about that case."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If you reassign a task that has a role assignment, Workflow Accelerator "
"will update the role variable, and assign all subsequent tasks with the "
"same role to the new assignee."
msgstr ""

msgid "Using a form field to assign a role"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"When you execute a process, you normally assign a specific person to a "
"role by using the assignee button to select someone. Sometimes, you want "
"this assignment to an explicit part of the process, to make sure the "
"assignment happens at the right time. For example, you may find it "
"important to assign the *Support engineer* before completing an *Initial "
"investigation* task."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"You can do this by adding the role assignment to a form, because you can "
"use task assignment roles as process variables, just like any other "
"*User* form field."
msgstr ""

msgid "Adding the *Support engineer* role assignment to a form"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"To add a role assignment to a form, first define the process role, such "
"as the *Support engineer* role created above, then on the form, under the"
" *Reuse field* heading, select the role variable to add it to the form."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Alternatively, you can first define the *Support engineer* role by adding"
" a field with type *User* to the *Initial investigation* task’s form, and"
" then select the *Support engineer* role on another user task’s *General*"
" configuration."
msgstr ""

msgid "Process locking"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"In the process builder, only one person can edit a process at a time. "
"While someone continues to edit a process, the `Processes` list shows a "
"message."
msgstr ""

msgid "The `Processes` list message while someone else edits the process"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"You can still open the process, but you will see a warning message "
"explaining that you cannot make changes:"
msgstr ""

msgid "Warning that you cannot edit a process at the same time as someone else"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"You can edit the process and make changes after the other person leaves "
"the process editor, by opening the `Tasks` list, for example."
msgstr ""

msgid "BPMN import"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"You can import a Workflow Accelerator process model from a BPMN 2.0 XML "
