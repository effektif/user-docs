msgid "The list of all tasks"

"name. Signavio Workflow Accelerator shows this indicator in red when a "
"task’s due date has arrived."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"You can use the controls on the right to filter the tasks list, which you"
" will find useful when the workload increases."
msgstr ""

msgid "Assigning tasks"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"You can assign a task to yourself, or someone else, to indicate who you "
"expect to work on the task. The assignee's :ref:`tasks inbox <tasks-"
"inbox>` lists assigned tasks, and the assignee receives task "
":ref:`notifications <notifications>` and :ref:`reminders <reminders>`."

"email address to filter it first."
msgstr ""

msgid "Completing tasks"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Use the highlighted `Done` button (the square on the green background) to"
" complete a task."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"When tasks have a form, the task page displays the form in the same "
"position and includes the button(s) to complete the task at the bottom of"
" the form. The task page normally only includes a `Done` button, but will"
" display multiple buttons when you use a decision. Each of those buttons "
"will register the decision and complete the task in one go."
msgstr ""

msgid "Creating case tasks"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"To create tasks, open a case, and use the tasks list to add a new task. "
"Enter the task title in the text box to create the task."
msgstr ""

msgid "Type the title of the new task and type Enter"
msgstr ""

msgid "After you have added a task, it appears in the list:"

msgid ""
"When a process starts, Signavio Workflow Accelerator creates a :ref:`case"
" <cases>` and starts all elements that do not have incoming transitions."
msgstr ""

msgid "Viewing task details"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Selecting a task opens the task details view, which you can use to edit "
"the task name, assign the task, or set a due date. Use this view to "
"complete a task’s form, if it has one. You can also add ad hoc subtasks."
msgstr ""

msgid "Details of a task within a case"
msgstr ""

msgid "Setting due dates"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"You can set a task’s due date, so that the assignee's tasks inbox "
"highlights overdue tasks. To set a task’s due date, open the task, and "
"select the clock icon to open the date selector."
msgstr ""

msgid "Setting a task’s due date"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"As well as setting the due date manually, in an open case, you can also "
"set a user task’s default due date in the process editor, on the user "
"task’s :ref:`reminders <reminders>` tab."
msgstr ""

msgid "Task filters"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The *All tasks* view includes several kinds of task filters, that you can"
" use to manage a long list of tasks."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"*Involvement filter* - shows tasks according to how they relate to you, "
"such as tasks you started."
msgstr ""

msgid "*Process* filter - shows tasks for a specific process."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"*Due date* filter - shows tasks according to their due dates, such as "
"only overdue tasks."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"*Completed* filter - shows complete tasks, which the task list normally "
"excludes."

" you to work on. To open the Inbox, select *Tasks* from the main menu and"
" select the *Inbox* tab."
msgstr ""

msgid "The tasks Inbox"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Each task shows the assignee - you for all Inbox tasks - and a link to "
"the task itself."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The left-hand side of the inbox has sections for tasks that have due "
"dates, so you can prioritise your work. The right-hand side lists tasks "
"that don’t have a due date."
msgstr ""

msgid "Reopening tasks"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"When the task page shows a `Reopen` button, it means that someone "
"completed the task but you can reopen it. You cannot reopen a task that "
"has a form, because completing the task finalises the form data. You may "
"want to reopen a task that you closed a task by accident, or when you "
"learn about additional work that belongs to this task. If you just forgot"
" to attach a document or make a comment, you can still do that without "
"reopening the task."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Reopening a task instead of creating a new task has the advantage that "
"the existing task retains its context."
msgstr ""

msgid "Skipping intermediate timer events"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"When a process includes an :ref:`intermediate-timer-event`, case "
"execution waits for the timer to complete before continuing. Sometimes, "
"you want to continue immediately without waiting for the timer."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"You can manually skip a timer, without waiting for its configured delay. "
"The :ref:`case details <cases-details>` view shows open timers under the "
":ref:`cases-other-activities` heading."

msgstr ""

msgid ""
"During case execution, an automatic task might fail to execute because it"
" has an invalid configuration. A :ref:`google-drive` task will fail if "
"you don’t configure a Google account, for example. You can manually skip "
"some kinds of failed task, so that case execution continues."
msgstr ""

msgid "An option to skip a task that failed to execute"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"To skip a failed task, use the *Skip task* button to the right of the "
"task name in the case’s task list."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"On the `Skip action` dialogue that opens, enter a reason to explain the "
"decision for skipping the task. The event stream will show the reason "
"with the task completion event, so other people will know why you skipped"
" the task."
msgstr ""

msgid "Retrying failed tasks"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"An automatic task might also fail for an external reason that you can "
"resolve. A :ref:`google-drive` task will fail if the configured Google "
"account doesn’t have permission to write to the selected Google Drive "
"folder, for example. You can manually retry some failed tasks, after "
"resolving the external issue, so that task completes successfully and "
"case execution continues."
msgstr ""

msgid "An option to retry a task that could succeed on the next try"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"To retry a failed task, use the *Retry task* button to the right of the "
