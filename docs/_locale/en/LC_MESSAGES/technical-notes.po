"Since `Microsoft stopped supporting Internet Explorer 9 and 10 for most "
"platforms on January 12, 2016 <https://support.microsoft.com/en-"
"us/help/17454/lifecycle-faq-internet-explorer>`_, it is getting "
"increasingly difficult for Signavio to provide a state-of-the-art user "
"experience while supporting these browsers. As we want to continue "
"innovating and provide the best features and user experience possible, we"
" will stop supporting Microsoft Internet Explorer 9 and 10 on December "
"31, 2017. If you use Internet Explorer 9 or 10, we recommend switching to"
" one of the following browsers as soon as possible:"
