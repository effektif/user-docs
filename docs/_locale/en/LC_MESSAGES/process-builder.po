msgid "Process builder"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"A process defines a template for automating repetitive work, like a recipe "
"that describes the actions that you perform to achieve a goal. For example, "
"consider a :ref:`Hire employee <hire-employee>` process. Each time an "
"organization hires someone, the recruitment team has to complete a number of"
" tasks, including ‘Evaluate CV’, ‘Plan interview’ and ‘Interview candidate’."
" Each time someone starts the process, Signavio Workflow creates a new case."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Use the process builder to create and configure executable processes. You "
"can think of an executable process as a kind of software, but you will find "
"it easier to build automation using processes. With Signavio Workflow, non-"
"technical people can create useful processes."
msgstr ""

msgid "Creating a process"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"To create a process, select *Processes* in the main menu, then the *Create "
"new process* button. In the text input field, enter a process name."

msgid ""
"Use the following guidelines to choose a good process name, to make the list"
" of processes easier to read and talk about."

msgid "Describe the process goal."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Use an imperative verb phrase that completes a sentence like *For your next "

msgid "Use more than one word, to get a descriptive name."
msgstr ""

msgid "Avoid using more than three or four words."
msgstr ""

msgid "Avoid vague words like ‘manage’, ‘do’, ‘process’ or ‘handle’."

msgid ""
"Once you have created a process, continue to build the process model using "
"the following process builder sections."

":ref:`actions` define the flow for tasks and other steps in the process"
msgstr ""

msgid ":ref:`details` include process metadata and access control."
msgstr ""

msgid "Triggers"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"A trigger in a process specifies how the process starts. Triggers do not "
"have any relation to :ref:`start events <start-event>`."
msgstr ""

msgid "Manual trigger"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"A manual trigger gives you the simplest way to start a process. With a "
"manual trigger, you start processes manually in Signavio Workflow, by "
"selecting `Start new case` and then selecting the process to start."
msgstr ""

msgid "Form trigger"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"With a form trigger, you use a form to start a process. After selecting the "
"form trigger, you can use the form builder to specify form fields."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Form trigger configuration - using the form builder to define a trigger form"
msgstr ""

msgid "Email trigger"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"An email trigger starts a new case for each email that you send to the "
"trigger’s Signavio Workflow email address. Note this differs from reading an"
" existing email account, such as your own. After selecting the email "
"trigger, you can see its email address:"
msgstr ""

msgid "Mail trigger configuration"
msgstr ""

msgid "The email trigger creates a :ref:`trigger-email-variable`."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"You can use an email trigger by adding the trigger email address to a "
"mailing list, such as `support@example.com `or `info@example.com`. You’ll "
"have to ask the administrator of the mailing list to add the process "
"trigger’s email address to the list. Once you have done this, the process "
"trigger address will also receive any email sent to the mailing list, "
"starting the process in Signavio Workflow. You will then see the email in "
"the event stream:"
msgstr ""

msgid "Trigger mail in stream"
msgstr ""

msgid "Salesforce trigger"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"A Salesforce trigger starts a new case in response to Salesforce sending an "
"outbound message as part of a Salesforce workflow. Before you can use a "
"Salesforce trigger, configure :ref:`Salesforce Integration <salesforce-"

msgid "Example of a Salesforce trigger"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"In the process definition, you can use the Salesforce object fields from the"
" Salesforce message just like normal :ref:`variables <variables>`."
msgstr ""

msgid "Actions"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Actions represent the steps in a process - things to do. Action include "
"things like user tasks in Signavio Workflow, operations on a file in a "
"document management system or any other actions that represent work that "
"someone will perform as part of a process. When starting a process, Signavio"
" Workflow will ‘execute’ the actions in a process in the proper order. The "
"process :ref:`control flow <control-flow>` determines this ordering, using "
"transitions, gateways and events."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"A process can include different :ref:`action-types`. A user task will create"
" a task in a case. A ‘Send Email’ action will send an email. A ‘Google file "
"upload’ action will upload a file to a Google Drive folder."
msgstr ""

msgid "The *Process builder*’s actions palette"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The `BPMN "
"<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_Process_Model_and_Notation>`_ diagram"
" editor shows actions and control flow elements, such as events and "
"gateways. Use the diagram editor to add sequential flows between actions, "
"decisions and other control flow behaviour."
msgstr ""

msgid "Adding a transition"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"You can create a transition in the `Advanced flows` view. A transition "
"specifies sequential flow, which means the next action only starts when "
"someone has completed the previous one."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"To add a transition, click to select the first action. Several symbols "
"appear to the right of the selected element:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Start creating a transition by dragging the transition symbol to the "
"destination"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Click the transition symbol |transition-symbol| and drag it to the "
"destination element. When you drag the symbol over the destination element, "
"it indicates that you can drop to create the transition:"
msgstr ""

msgid "Creating a transition hovering over destination"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Release the mouse button over the destination to create the transition."
msgstr ""

msgid "Creating the next user task"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"You can easily create the next User Task in a process in the same way you "
"created transitions, above. Start by selecting the previous action:"
msgstr ""

msgid "Start creating the next user task by dragging the action symbol"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Click the rounded rectangle symbol |task-symbol| and drag it to an empty "
"place on the canvas."
msgstr ""

msgid "Drag the rounded rectangle symbol to an empty place"

msgid ""
"Drop the symbol where you want to create the next user task. Release the "
"mouse button to create new user task where you dropped it, with a transition"
" from the previous action."
msgstr ""

msgid "Adding the next user task and its transition at the same time"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Alternatively, just click the user task icon |task-symbol| to create a new "
"user task in the default location, with a transition."
msgstr ""

msgid "Changing the action type"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Sometimes, modifying a process means changing an action from one type to "
"another. In the recruitment process, you might change the action to reject "
"the candidate from a manual task to an automatic email task."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"To make this change, first select the action in the process editor to open "
"the configuration panel, then click the action type icon at the top-left "
"corner of the configuration panel to open the list of action types. Next, "
"select *Send Email* from the list to change the action type."
msgstr ""

msgid "Changing a :ref:`user-task` to a :ref:`send-email` task."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Changing the action type discards the previous action type’s configuration, "
"such as a user task form or an email template. If you change the action type"
" back, the original configuration will not be restored."
msgstr ""

msgid "Control flow elements"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The diagram also includes control flow elements, such as events and "
"gateways. Unlike actions, control flow elements don’t represent something "
"that should happen. Instead, you use events and gateways to specify the flow"
" between the actions."
msgstr ""

msgid "Details"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"In the process builder, select the *Details* tab to further configure the "
"process."
msgstr ""

msgid "Configuring process details"

msgid ""
"*Process owner* - shown on the *Processes* page to indicate who has "
"responsibility for a process model, and used as the default recipient of "
"some :ref:`notifications <notifications>`."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"*Process description* - documents a process, usually by describing the "
"process goal."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"*Case name template* - the name for new cases of this process, usually "
"containing trigger :ref:`variables <variables>` so that each case has a "
"different name."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Use the *Access control* tab to restrict access to this process and its "
"cases."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Use the *Field overview* tab to view and rename this process’ "
":ref:`variables <variables>`."
msgstr ""

msgid "Versions"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"When you use the process editor to edit your process model, Signavio "
"Workflow saves all of your changes immediately. You can go back and edit the"
" process again later, and it will not have changed. However, to execute a "
"process by starting a new case you need a published version."
msgstr ""

msgid "Publishing a process version"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The process editor’s `Versions` tab shows a list of published versions. "
"Until you publish the first version, this page shows a message that there "
"the process has ‘no published versions’."
msgstr ""

msgid "The process editor’s `Versions` tab with no published versions"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"You can only start a new case for a process that has a published version, "
"hence the light green button displays ‘Publish to run this process’. After "
"you publish the first version, the list shows version #1 and you can start a"
" new case using that version."
msgstr ""

msgid "The `Versions` list after publishing the first version"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Version #1 always has the description `Initial version`. For later versions,"
" you can add your own description."
msgstr ""

msgid "Adding version comments"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"After the first published version, you can add a comment to describe the "
"changes when you publish a new version of a process."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The `Publish changes` prompt, where you can add an optional version comment"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"You can omit the version comment, but it helps collaboration between team "
"members by making process modelling more transparent."
msgstr ""

msgid "Published versions with descriptive version comments"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"In this example, each version has a short comment that describes the "
"changes."
msgstr ""

msgid "Writing good version comments"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"When you write version comments, use the following tips to make them more "
"consistent and useful."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Make the comment an imperative phrase that starts with a word like ‘Add’ or "
"‘Fix’."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Capitalise the first word and don’t include a full-stop at the end, for "
"consistency."
msgstr ""

msgid "Describe specifics, instead of vaguely referring to ‘changes’."
msgstr ""

msgid "Keep it short; 3-10 words usually suffice."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Consider making the comment longer to explain why you made this change."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"You may find it easier to publish a series of small changes, creating a "
"number of intermediate versions instead of one big change. Fine-grained "
"versions make the version history more useful."
msgstr ""

msgid "Variables"
msgstr ""

msgid ":ref:`variables` store workflow data when the process runs."
msgstr ""

msgid "Roles"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Creating a role gives a process-specific name to whoever performs one or "
"more process tasks. You can optionally configure a role with a list of "
"candidates. Roles have the same function as swimlanes in BPMN."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Process roles differ from organizational roles. A process role only lasts "
"for the duration of a case, while organizational roles last longer and "
"relate to the job you perform at the organization. For example, when you "
"have a meeting, one person sometimes takes the role of chairperson. That "
"person doesn’t have the job title *Meeting chair* - they’ve just adopted "
"that role for the duration of the meeting."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"A process in Signavio Workflow can define roles, in the same way that a "
"business meeting ‘process’ has roles for whoever chairs the meeting (the "
"‘Chair’) and whoever takes minutes (the ‘Secretary’). The following meeting "
"process model assigns the tasks on the top row to the *Chair* and the tasks "
"on the bottom row to the *Secretary*."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"A *Meeting* process, with tasks for *Chair* (top row) and *Secretary* "
"(bottom row) roles"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"In each meeting (each :ref:`case <cases>` in Signavio Workflow), one person "
"takes the role of chair, and one the role of secretary. These assignments "
"generally don’t change during a meeting. Similarly, Signavio Workflow role "
"assignments don’t change during a case. Signavio Workflow automatically "
"assigns each new task with a role assignment to the person who already has "
"the role."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"In Signavio Workflow, a process role works like a workflow variable that you"
" use to assigning tasks. A role variable has the :ref:`type-user` type and "
"stores a single user."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"These process roles differ from organization roles. For example, you can "
"have the *Team lead* role in your organization, an assignment that does not "
"necessarily have an end date. A process role, such as *Meeting chair*, has a"
" different scope and only applies for the duration of a single case."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"To assign a role to a user task, open the task’s configuration panel, select"
" the `Assignment` tab, and use the `Assign using a role` menu on the right-"
"hand side."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"To assign a role, use the menu to create a new role or select an existing "
"role"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"You can also use the edit icon next to the role name to rename the role."
msgstr ""

msgid "Role candidates"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"You can use a role to assign multiple tasks a person from a group of "
"candidates. For example, you might have a support process that includes "
"three user tasks that you assign to a support engineer."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Assigning a task to a *Support engineer* role with candidates Alice and Ben"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Instead, assign the three tasks to a new role called ‘Support engineer’, and"
" add the relevant people as candidates for the role."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Creating the first task that has a role will notify all of the candidates "
"for the role. When one of the candidates takes the task, Signavio Workflow "
"will assign the subsequent tasks with the same role to the same person. That"
" helps this person work more efficiently because they have the context "
"knowledge about that case."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If you reassign a task that has a role assignment, Signavio Workflow will "
"update the role variable, and assign all subsequent tasks with the same role"
" to the new assignee."
msgstr ""

msgid "Using a form field to assign a role"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"When you execute a process, you normally assign a specific person to a role "
"by using the assignee button to select someone. Sometimes, you want this "
"assignment to an explicit part of the process, to make sure the assignment "
"happens at the right time. For example, you may find it important to assign "
"the *Support engineer* before completing an *Initial investigation* task."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"You can do this by adding the role assignment to a form, because you can use"
" task assignment roles as process variables, just like any other *User* form"
" field."
msgstr ""

msgid "Adding the *Support engineer* role assignment to a form"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"To add a role assignment to a form, first define the process role, such as "
"the *Support engineer* role created above, then on the form, under the "
"*Reuse field* heading, select the role variable to add it to the form."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Alternatively, you can first define the *Support engineer* role by adding a "
"field with type *User* to the *Initial investigation* task’s form, and then "
"select the *Support engineer* role on another user task’s *General* "
"configuration."
msgstr ""

msgid "Process locking"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"In the process builder, only one person can edit a process at a time. While "
"someone continues to edit a process, the `Processes` list shows a message."
msgstr ""

msgid "The `Processes` list message while someone else edits the process"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"You can still open the process, but you will see a warning message "
"explaining that you cannot make changes:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Warning that you cannot edit a process at the same time as someone else"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"You can edit the process and make changes after the other person leaves the "
"process editor, by opening the `Tasks` list, for example."
msgstr ""

msgid "BPMN import"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"You can import a Signavio Workflow process model from a BPMN 2.0 XML file. "
