Technical notes
===============
Signavio Workflow Accelerator supports all popular browsers.
At https://www.signavio.com/browser-compatibility you find a detailed description of the supported browsers.
The site also automatically checks whether you browser supports the Signavio products.

.. note::

  Since `Microsoft stopped supporting Internet Explorer 9 and 10 for most platforms on January 12, 2016 <https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/17454/lifecycle-faq-internet-explorer>`_, it is getting increasingly difficult for Signavio to provide a state-of-the-art user experience while supporting these browsers.
  As we want to continue innovating and provide the best features and user experience possible, we will stop supporting Microsoft Internet Explorer 9 and 10 on December 31, 2017.
  If you use Internet Explorer 9 or 10, we recommend switching to one of the following browsers as soon as possible:

  * `Google Chrome <https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/desktop/index.html>`_
  * `Microsoft Edge <https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/microsoft-edge>`_
  * `Mozilla Firefox <https://www.mozilla.org/en/firefox/new/>`_
  * `Internet Explorer 11 (only if none of the above is viable) <https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/internet-explorer-11-for-windows-7-details.aspx>`_
