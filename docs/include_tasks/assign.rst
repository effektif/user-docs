Assigning tasks
---------------

You can assign a task to yourself, or someone else, to indicate who you expect to work on the task.
The assignee's :ref:`tasks inbox <tasks-inbox>` lists assigned tasks,
and the assignee receives task :ref:`notifications <notifications>` and :ref:`reminders <reminders>`.

You can assign a task from anywhere a task appears in a task list.
First, click the assignee button immediately to the left of the task name,
to open the list of candidates.
