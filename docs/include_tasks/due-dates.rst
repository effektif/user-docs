Setting due dates
-----------------

You can set a task’s due date,
so that the assignee’s tasks inbox highlights overdue tasks.
To set a task’s due date, open the task,
and select the clock icon to open the date selector.

As well as setting the due date manually, in an open case,
you can also set a user task’s default due date in the process editor,
on the user task’s :ref:`reminders <reminders>` tab.
