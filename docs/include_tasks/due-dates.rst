Setting due dates
-----------------

You can set a task’s due date,
so that the assignee's tasks inbox highlights overdue tasks.
To set a task’s due date, open the task,
and select the clock icon to open the date selector.

   Setting a task’s due date

As well as setting the due date manually, in an open case,
you can also set a user task’s default due date in the process editor,
on the user task’s :ref:`reminders <reminders>` tab.
