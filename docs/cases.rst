Cases
=====

You can use a case as a small collaboration space for a particular goal.
For example, ‘Hire employee’ or ‘Sign contract’.
Cases typically represent more work than a simple task for a single person, but less than a whole project.

A case breaks the goal down into concrete action items (or tasks) so you can collaborate with other people.
The case brings together a set of tasks, a discussion and documents, and allows participants to share any relevant context information for the tasks.
