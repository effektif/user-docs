Forms
=====

In Effektif, you can use forms to enter information when you run a process.
There are two places where you can use a form: form triggers and user tasks.


Form triggers
-------------

You use a :ref:`form trigger <form-trigger>` 
to set the values of :ref:`workflow variables <variables>`
when you start a new case for a process.

.. figure:: /_static/images/forms/start-form.png

   Starting a new case with a form trigger

This form has a description
(`Enter personal details`)
and two fields.
The icon next to the `Name` field label indicates that the field has an additional description.

To add a form trigger to a process,
use the process builder’s :ref:`Triggers <triggers>` page to 
select `When a form is submitted`.


User task forms
---------------

You use a :ref:`user task <user-task>` form 
to view and edit the values of :ref:`workflow variables <variables>`.

.. figure:: /_static/images/forms/user-task-form.png

   Viewing and editing values on a user task form

To add a user task form to a process,
use the process builder’s :ref:`Actions <actions>` page to add a user task, 
and on the user task’s configuration panel, select the `Form` tab.


Viewing form data
-----------------

When you enter data in a form,
it appears on the case view’s event stream:

You can use the `forms` link at the top of event stream to only show form data.


Using the form builder
----------------------

To create a form in the process editor,
for a form trigger or user task,
you use the form builder.

The `Description` section in the form builder is a text area
that you can use to provide initial instructions to people who complete the form.
Use can use `Markdown`_ to format the description,
which makes it convenient to link to additional information, for example.

.. _Markdown: http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/basics

The `Add a field` second contains a field types palette.
Click one of the field types to add a field of that type to the form.

The `Reuse a field` section is a list of variables that have already been defined on other forms,
such as a trigger form:

.. figure:: /_static/images/forms/builder-reuse-field.png

   Adding an existing workflow variable to a form

Adding an existing field to a form makes it possible to view or update existing information,
such as a user task form that you use to complete information that’s missing from a trigger form.


Configuring form fields
-----------------------

When you add fields to a form, they are shown in a `Fields` section:

.. figure:: /_static/images/forms/builder-edit-field.png

   Configuring a form field in the process editor’s form builder

Select a field in the `Fields` section to open its configuration panel. 
The top row of the field configuration panel shows the field type label,
the editable field name.

To delete a field,
click the delete button in the top-right corner,
and click the confirmation tick mark button to confirm:

   Deleting a form field

The other field configuration properties are as follows.

* `Description` - an optional field description, shown via context-sensitive help icon
* `Initial value` - an optional default field value that is used to pre-populate the form
* `Read-only` - specifies that the value is not editable, used to display previously-entered information
* `Mandatory` - specifies that a field value is required, so that the form cannot be completed without a value
* `Allow entering multiple values` - specifies that the field has a list of values that you add and remove independently

Text fields also have an additional `Multi-line` option 
that specifies that the form field be displayed as a multi-line text input area,
for longer text values.

When you enable the `Allow entering multiple values` option, the field is shown differently on forms.
Each value you enter is added to the list.
Use the × icon to remove a value.

Choice fields have a `Options` - the list of values to choose between:

Date fields have a `Date/time` option for choosing between a date and time, just a date without a time of day, or just a time:

User fields also have a `Candidates` option that you can use to choose which users can be selected:
