Copying & deleting processes
----------------------------

You can create a copy of a process or delete it using the process menu shown in the previous section.

The `Create a copy` option duplicates the process in the same organisation.
You may find it useful to duplicate a process if you want to experiment with changes without publishing changes to a process that people are using.
You may also want to duplicate a process to model a special case of the process, instead of adding a conditional flow to the standard process.

The `Delete process` option permanently deletes a process and all of its cases.
You cannot undo this operation, so you must enter a confirmation.
You might want to delete a process that you created by duplicating another process in order to experiment with changes in the model.

In Effektif, you cannot currently delete cases, which you might want to do if you have created test cases while developing the process.
However, you can use `Create a copy` and `Delete process` to duplicate a process and then delete the original.
This deletes all of the cases with the original process, and leaves a copy with no cases.
