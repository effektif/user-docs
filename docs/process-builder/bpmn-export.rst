BPMN export
-----------

You can export an Effektif process model as a BPMN 2.0 XML file.
This is useful if you want to open the model in another tool that supports BPMN,
or to make a backup that you can load using the :ref:`BPMN import <bpmn-import>` option.

To export a process model, first open it in the Effektif process editor.
Select the menu next to the `Publish changes` button,
then select `Export BPMN 2.0 XML`.

   Using the `Export BPMN 2.0 XML` option to save a process model in a file

This results in a file download that describes your process model in BPMN format.
There’s only one kind of BPMN file, so there aren’t any options to configure.
