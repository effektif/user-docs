Using the form builder
----------------------

To create a form in the process editor,
for a form trigger or user task,
you use the form builder.

   The process editorâ€™s form builder for a new empty form

Use the `Description` text area to provide initial instructions to people who complete the form.
You can use `Markdown <http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/basics>`_ to format the description,
which makes it convenient to link to additional information, for example.

The `Add a field` second contains a field types palette.
Click one of the field types to add a field of that type to the form.

The `Reuse a field` section lists variables that the process has already defined on other forms,
such as a trigger form:

   Adding an existing workflow variable to a form

Adding an existing field to a form makes it possible to view or update existing information,
such as a user task form that you use to complete information the person who started the case did not enter on the trigger form.
