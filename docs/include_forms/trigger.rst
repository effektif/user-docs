   Starting a new case with a form trigger

This form has a description
(`Enter personal details`)
and two fields.
The icon next to the `Name` field label indicates that the field has an additional description.

To add a form trigger to a process,
use the process builderâ€™s :ref:`Triggers <triggers>` page to
select `When a form is submitted`.
